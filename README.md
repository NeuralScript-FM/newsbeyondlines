#  NewsLens — AI-Powered News Bias & Framing Detector

**NewsLens** is an AI-driven web application that analyzes news headlines and short articles to detect **bias, framing, propaganda techniques, and AI-generated writing patterns**. It helps users understand *how* news is presented and *what it implies*, rather than verifying factual truth.



##  Features

- **Bias & Framing Detection:** Identify loaded or emotionally charged language, selective emphasis, and framing shifts
- **Propaganda Indicators:** Detect fear appeal, blame framing, oversimplification, or exaggeration
- **AI-Generated Text Detection:** Estimate if content shows AI-assisted writing patterns
- **Narrative Insights:** Suggest who may benefit or lose from a headline and what the intended impact might be
- **Explainable Output:** Human-readable explanations with confidence scores



##  Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology / Tool                     |

| Frontend    | HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla / optional React) |
| Backend     | Python (Flask / FastAPI)             |
| NLP         | HuggingFace Transformers, VADER, TextBlob |
| AI Logic    | Prompt-engineered LLMs (for inference and framing analysis) |
| Data        | Manually curated news headlines + AI-generated examples |
| Deployment  | Optional: Streamlit, Heroku, or local Flask server |

```



##  Getting Started 

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https:/NeuralScript-FM/github.com//newslens.git
cd newslens
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the backend server:**

```bash
python app.py  # or uvicorn main:app --reload if using FastAPI
```

5. **Open the frontend in a browser** or visit local URL if using Streamlit/Flask.

##  Limitations

- NewsLens provides **interpretive analysis**, not fact-checking
- Bias detection is heuristic and model-based; results are **suggestive, not definitive**
- Small datasets (demo-level) limit coverage and accuracy
- AI detection is probabilistic and **may produce false positives/negatives**



##  Future Enhancements

- Multi-source comparison for the same news story
- Browser plugin for real-time analysis
- Dataset expansion and fine-tuning for higher accuracy
- Visualization of bias trends over time



##  Development Notes

- Initial scaffold and backend logic were AI-assisted
- Feature design, system architecture, and evaluation criteria were defined by the author
- All outputs and interface decisions are intentional for demo purposes
